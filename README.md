# Music Share

Project Zomboid Mod. Allows players to share YouTube links for music in an immersive manner to those nearby.

This mod will make requests to a web server operated by me in order to use the YouTube API to extract a title and duration for the YouTube links posted. 
This request will be made against e.g. https://zedspace.eiradir.net/pz/media/youtube/dQw4w9WgXcQ from your server. 
In a future update, I will make this configurable so you could host your own resolver instead.

## New HUD Elements

### Music Share

- This window allows sharing music links with nearby players.
- Nearby players will see the music icon on the left glow purple, as well as the title of the song showing next to it.
- Players can then click the music icon, and press "Listen" to open the shared song on YouTube.
- The mod roughly tracks the duration since the music has been shared, so that players will somewhat stay in sync
