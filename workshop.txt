description=[b]This mod will make requests to a web server operated by me in order to use the YouTube API to extract a title and duration for the YouTube links posted.[/b]
description=This request will be made against "https://zedspace.eiradir.net/pz/media/youtube/<youtubeVideoId>" from your server. In a future update, I will make this configurable so you could host your own resolver instead.

description=    [*] This window allows sharing music links with nearby players.
description=    [*] Nearby players will see the music icon on the left glow purple, as well as the title of the song showing next to it.
description=    [*] Players can then click the music icon, and press "Listen" to open the shared song on YouTube.
description=    [*] The mod roughly tracks the duration since the music has been shared, so that players will somewhat stay in sync.
